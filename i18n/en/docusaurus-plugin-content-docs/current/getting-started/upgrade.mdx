# Upgrade

:::tip
Before upgrading, be sure to back up your database and files.
:::

## Upgrade process

Choose the corresponding upgrade method according to your installation method.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs defaultValue="docker" groupId="upgrade">
  <TabItem value="server" label="Upgrade from server">

From the official [Typecho website](https://typecho.org/download) website, download the latest version of Typecho:

```bash
wget https://github.com/typecho/typecho/releases/latest/download/typecho.zip
```

Unzip Typecho to the temporary directory:

```bash
unzip typecho.zip -d /tmp/typecho
```

:::tip
It is recommended to stop the webserver before performing file replacement to avoid file conflicts.
:::

Delete the following files and directories in the Typecho directory on the web server:

- `/admin/`
- `/var/`
- `/index.php`
- `/install.php`

:::caution
Please do not delete the `/usr/` directory, because this directory contains your theme, plug-ins and uploaded files, and it does not need to be upgraded.
:::

Upload/copy the following files and directories from the temporary directory to the Typecho directory on the web server:

- `/admin/`
- `/var/`
- `/index.php`
- `/install.php`

At this point, the upgrade is complete! Don't forget to start again the web server.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="docker" label="Upgrade from Docker">

:::caution
The upgrade of the Docker container that contains Typecho requires the container to be recreated.
:::

Execute the following command to delete the old container and create a new container:

```bash
docker pull joyqi/typecho:latest
docker stop typecho
docker rm typecho
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name typecho -v ./typecho:/app/usr -e TYPECHO_SITE_URL=https://[YOUR DOMAIN NAME] -d joyqi/typecho:latest
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Upgrade from Docker Compose">

To upgrade Typecho with Docker Compose, you only need to pull the image again and restart the container:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Complete the upgrade

After the upgrade is complete, browse to the Typecho backend and log in as administrator. If there is a database upgrade operation, Typecho will automatically guide you through it.
